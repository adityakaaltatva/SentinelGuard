  "description": "SentinelGuard is a cloud-security detection and posture-monitoring system focused on practical, high-signal rules rather than academic noise. It inspects IAM configurations, storage permissions, container build files, supply-chain metadata, and IaC drift to expose vulnerabilities that actually get exploited in real environments. The system is built as a modular engine with a detection pipeline, enrichment layer, rule-runtime, and a clean deployment story through Helm charts.",
